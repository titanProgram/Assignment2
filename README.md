WEEK 1
Created requirements document and created spaceship model in blender. Having trouble with rotating the 3D object in unity’s 2D game interface. Creating 3D ship took 2 hours to make and time needs to be put into learning Blender.

WEEK 2
Decided to use free licence 2D sprites so I can focus more on the coding aspect of the game instead of spending hours making all the game models in blender or gimp. Got a basic idea on how to procedurally generate the world, by dividing the world up into tiles.

WEEK 3
Lost all my work because of a git error! Spent this week working on the bullet class.

WEEK 4
Got the basic behaviours of enemy01 working!
